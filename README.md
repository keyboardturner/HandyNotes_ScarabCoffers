# HandyNotes_ScarabCoffers
AQ20 / 40 Scarab Coffer Locations using the HandyNotes addon.

<p>Places the locations of the scarab chests in Ahn'Qiraj Temple and Ahn'Qiraj Ruins. While player coordinates don't work in dungeons, you can still see map POIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scarab Coffers contain a variety of items required for Ahn'Qiraj quests and can be used to increase your reputation with the Brood of Norzdormu. These quests can give transmog sets (often referred to as <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/temple-of-ahnqiraj-transmog-sets">Tier 2.5</a>) and other items.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This will not work in WoW Classic as there are no maps in instances. Don't.</span></p>
<p>There is no way of knowing if you've looted a chest already and I think it'd be too complicated to devise anything more than that. This is meant to be a simple lightweight addon that shows scarab coffer locations.</p>
<p>If you find additional scarab coffer locations, send a screenshot of the map location and coordinates. You can still get map coordinates of the cursor in an instance, just not your player coords. I'm pretty sure I got them all but it's always possible I missed one considering wowpedia/wowhead even forgot some that I've included in this addon.</p>
